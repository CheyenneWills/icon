<H1>Building Version 9.4 of Icon from Source</H1>

<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P> These instructions explain how to build and install the source code of
<A HREF=relnotes.htm>Version 9.4 of Icon</A> under Unix.
For instructions on installing a binary release, see
<A HREF=install.htm>Installing Icon Binaries</A>.

<P>
To the programmer, this version is upwards compatible with previous ones;
but to the installer, there are some significant differences:
<UL>
    <LI> The Icon program library is now part of the source distribution
    <LI> Icon executables can be relocated without editing
</UL>
A more detailed discussion of these changes is available
<A HREF=files.htm>separately</A>.

<P> These instructions assume that you have unpacked the Icon 
distribution file onto a disk.
All commands are issued in the top-level directory so created.

<H2> Configuring </H2>

<P> The Icon source package contains configurations for a variety of
Unix platforms.
Type <CODE>make Configure</CODE> to see the list of known configurations.
A status report for any system can be viewed by entering
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Status name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Choose the configuration name that matches your system's
architecture and operating system.

<P> If your system is not among those listed, you will need to port the code.  
This is usually a fairly simple matter that involves copying an existing
configuration and editing it to match the target system.
For more information, see
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd238.htm">
Configuring the Source Code</A>.
While that document has not been revised for the Icon 9.4 file structure,
it is still correct in the essentials.

<P> Most Unix systems include the X Window System; type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make X-Configure name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to configure Icon with graphics.
If your system does not include the X window system, type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Configure name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to configure Icon without graphics.

<P> Installation using any of the supplied configurations <EM>should</EM>
be routine, but some of those were contributed for systems we cannot test,
and it is possible that some minor tweaking may be required.
If so, or if you develop a new configuration, we'd like to hear about it
by e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:icon-project@cs.arizona.edu">icon-project@cs.arizona.edu</A>.

<H2> Building </H2> 

<P> After Configuring, type <CODE>make</CODE> to build the Icon system.
This single step now builds:
<UL>
    <LI> The icon translator and interpreter
    <LI> Program library procedures
    <LI> VIB and other graphics utilities, if graphics are enabled
</UL>

<P> There may be a few warnings on some platforms, but there should be
no fatal errors.
If there are problems, fix them in the <CODE>config/unix/</CODE>platform
directory and repeat the configuration step.

<H2> Testing </H2> 

<P> To verify a successful build, type <CODE>make Samples</CODE>.
This command runs a small set of automated tests.
If no differences are reported, you have a functioning Icon system.

<P> A more extensive test set is run by <CODE>make Test</CODE>.
One of these tests displays values of Icon keywords
(such as <CODE>&amp;date</CODE>) that can vary from run to run.
No other differences should be reported.

<P> A successful graphics build can be confirmed by executing
<CODE>bin/colrbook</CODE>, the color book utility, with no arguments.
It should display a spectrum of colors along the left and a set
of recessed panes to the right.
Click anywhere on the spectrum to fill colors in the panes.
Click <CODE>QUIT</CODE> (in the upper left corner) to exit.

<H2> Installing </H2> 

<P> Icon can be run directly from the location in which it was built.
To do this, simply add the <CODE>bin</CODE> directory to your shell's
search path.
See the Icon <A HREF=icont.txt>man page</A> for instructions on
building and running Icon programs.
Or see the Icon books, as supplemented by the
<A HREF=relnotes.htm>release notes</A>.

<P> If you wish to install the binaries elsewhere,
choose a location for a directory dedicated to Icon --
for example, <CODE>/opt/icon</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/local/icon</CODE>.
Enter
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Install dest=</CODE><VAR>directory</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to create this directory (if necessary) and install Icon.
This creates subdirectories <CODE>bin</CODE>, <CODE>lib</CODE>,
<CODE>doc</CODE>, and <CODE>man</CODE>. 

<P> You can make symbolic links from other locations
to programs in the Icon <CODE>bin</CODE> directory.
For example, you can link
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/icont</CODE> to <CODE>/opt/icon/bin/icont</CODE>.
If you do this, link at least
<CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>iconx</CODE>, and (if present) <CODE>vib</CODE>.
You can additionally link any of the other executable utilities in the
<CODE>bin</CODE> directory.

<P> To package up a compressed tar file of the binaries
created by the build process, enter <CODE>make Package</CODE>.

<H2> Cleaning Up </H2>

<P> Type <CODE>Make Clean</CODE> to remove intermediate files created
during the build process.  This command preserves the contents of the
<CODE>bin</CODE> and <CODE>lib</CODE> directories, so the built system
remains functional.

<P> To restore everything to its original state, type <CODE>make Pure</CODE>.
This removes all the newly built files and requires restarting at the
configuration step for a rebuild.
