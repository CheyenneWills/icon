Icon Version 9.3.2 DOS implementations

iconcns - A Windows95 console version of icont and iconx
iconmx  - The DOS extended version of icont and iconx

The console version has the advantage of handling Windows 95's long file =
names, but obviously cannot run under pure DOS - only a Windows 95 DOS =
box. The extended DOS version "feels" faster, but this has not been =
confirmed.

Both versions have the -A option of icont, which produces a standalone =
executable (the .icx file appended to a copy of iconx.exe).
