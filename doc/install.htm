<P> &nbsp;

<P> These instructions explain how to install Unix binaries of
<A HREF=relnotes.htm>Version 9.4 of Icon</A>.
For instructions on building an Icon source package, see
<A HREF=build.htm>Building Icon from Source</A>.

<P> An Icon binary distribution unpacks to produce a directory with
four subdirectories: <CODE>bin</CODE>, <CODE>lib</CODE>,
<CODE>doc</CODE>, and <CODE>man</CODE>.
In contrast with previous versions of Icon, these binaries are
immediately ready for use and do not need to be edited by a Setup script.

<P> The Icon directory can be renamed or moved anywhere convenient.
We suggest <CODE>/opt/icon</CODE> for new installations, but
any location is acceptable.
It is only important that that the <CODE>bin</CODE> and <CODE>lib</CODE>
directories retain those names as members of a common parent directory.
(More details about the Icon file organization are available
<A HREF=files.htm>separately</A>.)

<P> You can make symbolic links from other locations
to programs in the Icon <CODE>bin</CODE> directory.
For example, you can link
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/icont</CODE> to <CODE>/opt/icon/bin/icont</CODE>.
If you do this, link at least
<CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>iconx</CODE>, and (if present) <CODE>vib</CODE>.
You can additionally link any of the other executable utilities in the
<CODE>bin</CODE> directory.

<P> For instructions on building and running Icon programs, see the
<CODE>icont</CODE> <A HREF=icont.txt>man page</A>
and the <A HREF=relnotes.htm>release notes</A>.
For information about the Icon language, see the 
<A HREF=docguide.htm>documentation guide</A>.
