Please note:  This distribution includes both a compiler and an interpreter,
but only the interpreter is supported.  It gets into execution quickly and
is fast enough for almost all applications.  Although the compiler produces
programs that run faster, it requires a large amount of memory and disk
space and is slow to get into execution, and we no longer maintain it.
