TO DO -- IPL
<ARIZONA-ONLY>

identify core modules by a comment in each
clean up spelling in documentation comments
clean up undeclared identifiers in procs/gprocs

are there any automated tests for the IPL programs?
should there be?

reconsider how to do documentation 
   don't list everything in IPDxxx
   check other IPDs etc in docs directory
   where do pdx files come from?  (or abandon)

not all procedures have #: comments, so permuted index is incomplete
   abandon it?  add comments?

note in documentation that packs are not included!

include version numbers on index page, page URL, download URL, etc.
redo index layout using grid: (index, part, full) x (basic, gpx, mticon)
