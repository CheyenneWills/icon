Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	None on x86, Alpha, PowerPC, or SPARC.

	On Intel Itanium:  change "-O2" to "-O" in Makedefs after
	configuring.  This fixes errors seen in the "large" test
	of multiprecision integers.

	On HP PA-RISC architecture:  Icon is not functional.  For
	reasons that are not understood, real (floating-point)
	values do not work.

Comments:

	Tested on various Red Hat systems ranging from 6.0 to 7.2,
	and on several different Debian 3.0 prerelease systems.

	This configuration can use pthreads for context switching.
	On some architectures that is the only option.
