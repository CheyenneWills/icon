Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.4.1

Installer:

	(with thanks to Richard Aguirre)

Missing features:

	Dynamic loading (loadfunc).  This could probably be enabled
	if you have patch PHSS_22514 installed.

Comments:

	HP/UX uses the LPATH environment variable as a path to the linker.
	This conflicts with the use of LPATH in link declarations under
	the Icon compiler.
