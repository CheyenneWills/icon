System configuration:

	Apple Macintosh running MacOS X (10.1 or newer)

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.4.1

Installer:

	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	Icon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.  The
	MacOS Developer Tools must be installed.  (These come
	with MacOS on a CD that is not always installed.)

	An Icon installation with graphics requires the presence
	of XFree86; see (e.g.)
	    http://xfree86.org/
	    http://www.xdarwin.org/
	    http://www.darwinfo.org/howto/x.shtml
	    http://www.mrcla.com/XonX/

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure"
	instead of "make X-Configure" when building.

	Tested with MacOS 10.2.3.
	Graphics tested with XFree86 4.1.2 on MacOS 10.1.4.
