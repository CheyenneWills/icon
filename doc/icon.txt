ICON(1)                                                   ICON(1)

NAME
       icon - execute Icon program

SYNOPSIS
       icon sourcefile [ arg ... ]
       icon -P 'program' [ arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Icon  is a simple interface for executing programs written
       in the Icon programming  language.   The  source  code  is
       translated  and  linked, then executed with the given list
       of arguments.

       Without -P, a single source file is read; its name must be
       given  exactly and need not end in .icn.  With -P, a small
       program can be embedded within a larger shell script.

       An Icon source file can be  made  directly  executable  by
       setting  the  appropriate permission bits and beginning it
       with a shell header.  If the first line of the file is
            #!/usr/bin/env icon
       then icon is found on the command search path  and  called
       to process the program upon execution.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment  variables  described  under icont(1) can
       also be used with the icon  command.   Normally,  none  of
       these are needed.

SEE ALSO
       icont(1),  the full-featured interface supporting separate
       compilation, multiple source files, and other features.
