System configuration:

	Linux (on all hardware platforms)

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.4.2

Installer:

	Gregg Townsend
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

	with special thanks to Christian Hudon for additional testing

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	None on x86, Alpha, SPARC, ARM, s390, or m68k.

	On Intel Itanium:  change "-O2" to "-O" in Makedefs after
	configuring.  This fixes errors seen in the "large" and
	"lgint" tests of multiprecision integers.

	On PowerPC: Large integers don't work; the cause is unknown.

	On HP PA-RISC architecture:  Icon is not functional.  For
	reasons that are not understood, real (floating-point)
	values do not work.

Comments:

	Tested on the platforms above using Debian Linux.  Also
	tested on x86 and Itanium using various Red Hat versions
	ranging from 7.1 to 9.

	This configuration can use pthreads for context switching.
	On some architectures that is the only option.
