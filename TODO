TO-DO LIST FOR ICON SOURCE 
(excluding IPL, which has its own TODO file)

<<ARIZONA-ONLY>>



MUST DO FOR V9.4 RELEASE

Any additional documentation needed?
Add index.htm?  Document feature deletions?

Beta release to "friends of Icon"?



DOCUMENTATION / DISTRIBUTION

prune "ARIZONA-ONLY" files from distribution.

Document these changes:
    More internal cleanup for portability
    Non-Unix impls will need some work
    No m4
    Compiler/visualization/extcall/etc unsupported

Doc icall.h / remove extcall stuff / desupport? or ref old IPD?

clarify porting guide -- see jan2000 email
encode version number in tar file ID, URL, etc

make .rpm binaries for RedHat?


BUILD / CONFIGURATION

add MacOS X port

redo test organization?
Use common script for make {Samples, Test}
Incorporate /home/icon/tests/preproc somewhere  (in pp dir, as "make test"?)


FEATURES

fix graphics bugs that require corresponding library code fixes?

support more than 256 colors; read JPEG files
set maximum memgrowth increment; avoid thrashing

implement 'icont -X file args...'  allowing scriptable icon files
implement option to embed iconx in executable

implement co-expression switch using pthreads


ICON PROGRAM LIBRARY

identify core modules by a comment in each
clean up spelling in documentation comments
clean up undeclared identifiers in procs/gprocs

reconsider documentation
   don't list everything in IPDxxx
   check other IPDs etc in docs directory

not all procedures have #: comments, so permuted index is incomplete
   abandon it?  add comments?

note in documentation that packs are not included!

include version numbers on index page, page URL, download URL, etc.
redo index layout using grid: (index, part, full) x (basic, gpx, mticon)
