<P> &nbsp;

<P> This document tells how to install Unix binaries of
<A HREF=ver94.htm>Version 9.4 of Icon</A>.
For instructions on building a source package of Icon, see
<A HREF=build.htm>Building Icon from Source</A>.

<P> An Icon binary distribution unpacks to produce a directory with
four subdirectories: <CODE>bin</CODE>, <CODE>lib</CODE>,
<CODE>doc</CODE>, and <CODE>man</CODE>.
Unlike those in previous versions of Icon, these binaries are
immediately ready for use and do not need to be edited by a Setup script.

<P> The parent Icon directory can be placed anywhere convenient.
We suggest <CODE>/opt/icon</CODE> for new installations, but
any location is acceptable, and the directory may be renamed.
It is only important that that the <CODE>bin</CODE> and <CODE>lib</CODE>
directories retain those names as members of a common parent directory.
(More details about the Icon file organization are available
<A HREF=files.htm>separately</A>.)

<P> It is possible to make symbolic links to the programs in the
<CODE>bin</CODE> subdirectory; for example, you can link
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/icont</CODE> to <CODE>/opt/icon/bin/icont</CODE>.
If you use symbolic links, link at least
<CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>iconx</CODE>, and (if present) <CODE>vib</CODE>.
You can additionally link any of the other executable utilities in the
<CODE>bin</CODE> directory.

<P> Icon is used by adding its <CODE>bin</CODE> directory to the shell
search path.  See the Icon <A HREF=icont.txt>man page</A> for instructions
on building and running Icon programs.
Or see the Icon books, as supplemented by the
<A HREF=ver94.htm>Version 9.4</A> notes.
