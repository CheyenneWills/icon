Comments:

	Tested most recently on Ubuntu 13.04 (Linux kernel 3.8.0-21).

	Ubuntu may require package installation in order to build:
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev

	You may also want to add some old-style fonts, because Icon can't
	use the new Xft scalable fonts:
	$ sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi  [or -75dpi, or both]
