<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P> Version 9.4 of Icon is a modified and repackaged version
based on version 9.3.2. 
The changes make it easier to maintain, install, and use under Unix. 
Most significant are changes to path searching, described below,
and the inclusion of the Icon program library as a standard part
of all Unix source and binary distributions.

<P> The Icon language is unchanged, and this 9.4 Unix implementation
remains compatible at the source level with Icon 9.3 for Windows.

<P> The command-line interface to Icon is described by the 
<A HREF="icont.txt">man page</A>.

<P> Program library documentation is contained within the source code.
Extracted documentation is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ipl.htm">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ipl.htm</A>.

<P> Other sources of documentation can be found in
<A HREF="faq.htm"> the Icon FAQ </A> and on the Icon web site,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon</A>.

<P> For installation instructions, see
<A HREF=install.htm>Installing Binaries</A> or
<A HREF=build.htm>Building from Source</A> as appropriate.

<H2> Recent feature additions </H2>

<P> A few features have been added since the publication of the Icon books;
these are described below.

<H3> Reading foreign text files </H3>

<P> The function <CODE>read()</CODE> recognizes
three kinds of line terminators when reading a file
opened in translated mode:
Windows (CR+LF), Macintosh (CR), or Unix (LF).
Consequently, text files created on one platform can be
read by an Icon program running on a different platform. 

<H3> Reading directory contents </H3>

<P> The files in a directory can be listed by opening the directory as a file.
Subsequent reads return the names of the files contained in the directory.
The names are returned in no particular order, and for Unix, the directories 
<CODE>"."</CODE> and <CODE>".."</CODE> are included.

<H3> Path searching </H3>

<P> Under Unix, colons (<CODE>:</CODE>) may now separate directories in the
<CODE>LPATH</CODE> and <CODE>IPATH</CODE> environment variables.
The Icon translator and linker search these paths when looking for
<CODE>$include</CODE> and <CODE>link</CODE> files respectively.

<P> The Icon program library is now searched automatically, but
<CODE>LPATH</CODE> and <CODE>IPATH</CODE> can still be set to control
the search order.
For version 9.4, the effective path is:
<OL>
	<LI> the current directory
	<LI> directories named by the environment variable
	<LI> the Icon library directory
</OL>

<P> Other changes affect the configuration of Icon at installation time
and the way executable Icon programs locate the interpreter.
These changes, which are transparent to most users, are discussed
in more detail on the <A HREF="files.htm">File Organization</A> page.
