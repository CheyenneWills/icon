TO-DO LIST FOR ICON PROGRAM LIBRARY

<<ARIZONA-ONLY>>


identify core modules by a comment in each
clean up spelling in documentation comments
clean up undeclared identifiers in procs/gprocs

reconsider documentation
   don't list everything in IPDxxx
   check other IPDs etc in docs directory

not all procedures have #: comments, so permuted index is incomplete
   abandon it?  add comments?

note in documentation that packs are not included!

include version numbers on index page, page URL, download URL, etc.
redo index layout using grid: (index, part, full) x (basic, gpx, mticon)

add ccscan to IPL?
add other new progs?
