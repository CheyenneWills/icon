This directory contains Version 9.3.2 of the Icon programming language.

This material is in the public domain.  You may use and copy this material
freely. This privilege extends to modifications, although any modified
version of this system given to a third party should clearly identify your

Icon web site listed below.

Please note:  This distribution includes both a compiler and an interpreter,
but only the interpreter is supported.  It gets into execution quickly and
is fast enough for almost all applications.  Although the compiler produces
programs that run faster, it requires a large amount of memory and disk
space and is slow to get into execution, and we no longer maintain it.
