Known bugs:

	None

Comments:

	Icon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.  The
	Xcode Developer Tools must be installed.  (These come
	with MacOS on a CD that is not always installed.)

	An Icon installation with graphics requires the X11 window
	system, available from Apple but not always installed.
	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure"
	instead of "make X-Configure" when building.

	Tested with MacOS 10.4.1 (Tiger).
