	Icon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.  The
	Xcode Developer Tools must be installed to build Icon.

	This configuration can use pthreads for context switching.

	Tested with MacOS 10.6.0 (Snow Leopard), using Xcode 3.2
	and GCC 4.2.1.
