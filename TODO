Incorporate /home/icon/tests/preproc somewhere  (in pp dir, as "make test"?)


FEATURES

implement 'icont -X file args...'  allowing scriptable icon files

implement option to embed iconx in executable

support more than 256 colors; read JPEG files

set maximum memgrowth increment; avoid thrashing

ICON PROGRAM LIBRARY

identify core modules by a comment in each

reconsider documentation
   don't list everything in IPDxxx
   check other IPDs etc in docs directory

not all procedures have #: comments, so permuted index is incomplete
   abandon it?  add comments?

note in documentation that packs are not included!

include version numbers on index page, page URL, download URL, etc.
redo index layout using grid: (index, part, full) x (basic, gpx, mticon)
