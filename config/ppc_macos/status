System configuration:

	Apple Macintosh running MacOS X (10.1 or newer)

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.4.1

Installer:

	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	Icon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.  The
	MacOS Developer Tools must be installed.  (These come
	with MacOS on a CD that is not always installed.)

	An Icon installation with graphics requires the X11 window
	system, available from several sources as "XFree86".
	This version of Icon was tested using Apple's X11, beta
	release 0.1.  Both the user package and SDK (software
	development kit) must be installed.

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure"
	instead of "make X-Configure" when building.

	Tested with MacOS 10.2.3 and Apple X11 public beta 0.1.
